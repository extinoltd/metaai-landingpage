# Metaaiautomator: Technical Overview

## Product Description
Metaaiautomator is a browser-based automation tool (Chrome Extension) designed specifically for  Meta Ai. It solves the problem of manual clicking by allowing users to queue thousands of prompts.

## Core Capabilities

### 1.  Meta Ai Batch Processing
Users can input a list of prompts via CSV or text area. The system injects these prompts into the  Meta Ai interface using DOM manipulation that mimics human typing speed to avoid bot detection.

### 2.  Meta Ai Auto Downloader
The extension monitors network requests and DOM mutations. When a new image is fully rendered, it is automatically fetched and saved to the user's local disk, solving the "how to download all images from  Meta Ai" problem.

### 3. Workflow Automation
- **Queue Management**: Pause, resume, and retry logic.
- **Human-Flow**: Randomizes delays between actions (3s-12s) to ensure safety.

## Localization & Internationalization
The web platform is architected for global accessibility:
- **Languages**: Supports 15 languages including English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic (with full RTL layout support), Portuguese, German, Japanese, Korean, Dutch, Vietnamese, Turkish, Bengali, Thai, Polish, and Russian.
- **Implementation**: React Context-based translation engine with dynamic document attribute updates (lang/dir).
- **SEO**: URL query parameter support (`?lang=es`) allows for deep linking and proper indexing of localized content.
